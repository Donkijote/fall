# 🎴 Fall* — Rules Specification

## 📖 Overview
Fall is a traditional Venezuelan card game played with the **Spanish 40-card deck**.  
It can be played in **duel (1v1)**, **three-player free-for-all (1v1v1)**, or **team mode (2v2)**.  
The first **player or team to reach 24 points** wins.

---

## 🎴 Deck
- **40 cards** from the Spanish deck.
- Suits: **golds, cups, spades, sticks**.
- Ranks: **1–7, 10–12** (8 and 9 are removed).

---

## 👥 Player Counts
- **1 vs 1** (duel).
- **1 vs 1 vs 1** (3-player).
- **2 vs 2** (team mode).

---

## 🏆 Objective
- First **player or team** to reach **24 points** wins.

---

## 🃏 Dealing & Setup
1. At the start of the game, each player draws a card.
    - The **highest card** becomes the **dealer**.
    - Turn order proceeds **counter-clockwise** (player to the dealer’s right goes first).

2. The **dealer** decides the deal order:
    - **Players first** → 3 cards per player, then deal the table.
    - **Table first** → deal table, then 3 cards per player.

3. **Table deal pattern:**
    - Dealer chooses **ascending (1-2-3-4)** or **descending (4-3-2-1)**.
    - Dealer reveals **4 cards** to the table.
    - If revealed cards match the chosen pattern → immediate bonus points to the dealer (or dealer’s team).

---

## 🔄 Turn Order
- Always **counter-clockwise** (right of dealer plays first).
- On a turn, a player must:
    1. **Announce a canto (sing)** if holding exactly 3 cards and eligible.
    2. **Play one card**:
        - **Capture** a card (or valid combo) from the table, or
        - **Throw** a card onto the table (no capture).

---

## ✋ Captures
- A card can capture a **same-rank card** from the table.
- **Cascade Rule:**  
  If the captured card can form a sequential chain (e.g., captured `2` → also take `3,4,5…`),  
  the capturing player takes the entire sequence.
- Captured card(s) + the played card go into the player’s **capture pile**.

**⚡ Special Rule — Fall**
- If a player **throws** a card onto the table…
- …and the **next player immediately captures it** with a card of the same rank → **Fall!**
- Fall points:
    - Rank **1–7** → +1 point
    - Rank **10** → +2 points
    - Rank **11** → +3 points
    - Rank **12** → +4 points

**Clean Table:**  
- If after a capture (single or cascade) the table is completely empty, the capturing player/team earns **+4 points**.

## 🎶 Hands (Sings)
Cantos are **special 3-card patterns** scored only when a player has all 3 cards in hand (before playing).
- If multiple players announce cantos, the **highest ranking canto wins**.
- If tied, the player **closest to the dealer** wins.
- Some cantos are **optional** (must be agreed before play), others are **mandatory**.
